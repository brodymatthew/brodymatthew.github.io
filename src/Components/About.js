            <p className="p1">I am from Annapolis, a small town that resides in Maryland with lots of sailing. I grew up playing many sports such as soccer, hockey, lacrosse, baseball, and I even swam competitively. I have a lovely pal in my German Shepherd, Scarlet. She is 3 years old and sheâ€™s better at sports than I am.</p>
            <p className="p2">After graduating from the University of Maryland in May of 2022, I began a self-study focused on computer science. During this time, I utilized various online resources to supply my many curiosities. Some of the topics I studied and engaged in included web development & design, cybersecurity, and software development.</p>
